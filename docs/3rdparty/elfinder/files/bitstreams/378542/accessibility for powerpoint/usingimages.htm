<h1>Using Images in Online Documents</h1>

<p class="border">All images (including graphs, charts or other visual mediums ie video clips) which appear in the Intranet must also be described in such a way that people who are not able to see the image can fully understand what the image is portraying.</p>

<p>Some people use browsers which cannot cope with images, others have visual impairments and cannot see small pictures (Internet Explorer can make the text of a properly designed web page bigger, but not the images). Others use screen readers to 'read' out the contents of a web page to them. If these screen readers come across an image they will read its short description and then offer the user the option to hear a longer description of the image.</p>

<p>You define this short description in the 'alt text' which Moodle will prompt you for when you insert an image. </p>

<p>Sometimes a short description is adequate; for example, for a purely decorative image like some clipart. For a clipart image of a lightbulb the following description would be acceptable:</p>

<div class="center">
<table width="40%" cellspacing="0" summary="table for layout purposes only" cellpading="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<img width="64" hspace="0" height="71" border="0" title="a lightbulb" alt="a lightbulb" src="images/lightbulb.gif" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description: &quot;a lightbulb&quot;
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>If the image is integral to the learning material (for example a graph, photograph or map) it must be described in more detail in a 'long description'. For example:</p>

<a name="image"></a><p><strong>Image:</strong></p>

<img width="279" hspace="0" height="328" border="0" title="photo of glass-fronted building" alt="photo of glass-fronted building" src="images/expimage.jpg" />   <a title="long description" href="longdesc/using_images_1.htm">d</a>

<p><strong>Long description:</strong></p>

<div class="border">
<p>The picture is taken from the inside of the Explore @Bristol building looking out through the glass panelling so the foreground shows this glass frontage.</p>

<p>Outside the building in the middle distance are the tourist signs and bus stops within the drop off zone for @Bristol. The tourist signs are attached to the top of a post and show directions to a variety of city attractions. On the lower part of the post is an upright rectangular sign which shows a map and bus routes. The outside area is empty of people.</p>

<p>On the main road (Anchor Road) there are 3 vehicles - one white car driving to the left (westwards) and a white van and grey car driving to the right (eastwards).</p>

<p>Beyond the road there are two trees which are in full leaf on the opposite pavement and behind this the grounds and buildings of Bristol Cathedral school. In is hard to distinguish individual buildings as there are also some reflections on the glass frontage but they are natural grey stone and red brick in colour and are a variety of shapes.</p>

<p>Bristol Cathedral is located behind these buildings in the background to the picture with the three rectangular towers and main structure visible.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for writing long descriptions:</h2>

<p>The 'long description' must be detailed and descriptive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give an overview of the image and its subject matter </li>
<li>Now move from left to right or top to bottom describing the image in more detail (remember to relate where one section you describe is in relation to the next one you deal with) </li>
<li>Use adjectives and always place them after the object they describe ie 'The woman's jacket is long, frayed and tartan' rather than 'The woman's long, frayed tartan jacket'. </li>
<li>If you are describing a graph name the axis and give an overall description of the general trends the graph shows as well as picking out any salient points ie the graph shows. For example, 'The graph shows prices steadily rising from £4.57 in January 2003 to a maximum price of £10.75 in May 2003 and then steadily falling again to £5.00 and then stays at this price for the rest of the year.' </li>
<li>If you are describing a pie chart, list what all the segments represent and the percentages associated with them. </li>
<li>A good way to test your work is to write a description of the image, give the description to someone who hasn't seen the image and ask them to draw what you have described.</li>
</ul>
<p class="borderdashed">The long description is linked to the image via a 'd' positioned to the right of the image on the webpage. When you click on the d you will be taken to a page containing the long description of the image (see example of how the 'd' link works above). Alternatively, you could include the description on the same page as the image, just underneath or to one side of it. This way it is readily available to all users. Just tell Vicki which you would prefer.</p>
